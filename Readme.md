This application is simple news application which contains two views. The application takes data from "https://api.currentsapi.services/v1/latest-news".
Used URLSession.
This project contain main view which is TableView and detail view.
In this project I had some practice with creation of UI elements by code, creation custom TableViewCell and caching main view images.
The problems of this app: 
-News titles is not cached.
-Detail view images not cached.
